    <h3>Chapter 1 & 2</h3>
    <p>Black South Africans were split up into tribes before apartheid, with the Zulu and Xhosa being the two largest. When it came to fighting European invaders, the Zulu were warriors, and the Xhosa employed strategic opposition.

        Despite Europeans forcing native South Africans to become Christians, Trevor Noah's mother Patricia, who was Xhosa, was a devoted Christian who took her family to several churches on Sundays. Trevor liked attending church, but he didn't love the convoluted minibus ride. When Patricia felt intimidated by a bus driver one day, she threw Trevor out of the vehicle to keep him safe. Though Trevor was unaware of it at the time, his mother saved his life.

        Trevor was raised by a Black mother and a White father during the apartheid era. Apartheid regulations that forbade inter-racial sexual connections made their relationship unlawful. Afrikaners assumed control of the South African government and implemented apartheid, a form of racial discrimination.

        Trevor was in a unique position at this stormy period in South Africa's history because of his mixed-race identity.
        In our country, we are witnessing a form of apartheid where getting a job is dependent on being the son or daughter of a prominent person in society. This unfair practice is being perpetuated despite the knowledge that it is wrong. Unfortunately, people hold the mentality that certain individuals deserve better opportunities based on their color, race, and economic class. This problem persists and needs to be addressed.
